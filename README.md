# EvolutionaryAlgorithmSceneGenerator
A background art generator using evolutionary algorithms

# How it works
Using game art provided by Glitch the Game (Thank you!) and the genetic algorithm library at https://github.com/subprotocol/genetic-js (thank you!), I created a scene generator whose fitness score is tied to how well images fit into the chosen themes.
The efficiency is achieved by using blob web workers asynchronously.
